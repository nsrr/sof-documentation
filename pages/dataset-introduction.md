# Dataset introduction

The [Study of Osteoporotic Fractures dataset](:files_path:/datasets) posted on the NSRR was prepared by the dataset owners at [SOF Online](https://sofonline.ucsf.edu/). Changes and updates to the source data and variable definitions have been coordinated in the [sof-data-dictionary repository](https://github.com/nsrr/sof-data-dictionary).

## Structure of the dataset

The dataset contains 461 records. Records can be linked to raw polysomnography data by using the **[sofid](https://www.sleepdata.org/datasets/sof/variables/sofid)** subject identifier.

## Variables from other SOF visits

SOF is a [longitudinal project with many visits](https://sofonline.ucsf.edu/PublicFiles/Complete_description_of_each_visit.pdf). The polysomnography data were collected at Visit 8 (2002-2004). The NSRR team selected other variables to include from SOF Online, some of which come from other visits. Please note variable prefixes (e.g. **v1** for Visit 1, **v4** for Visit 4, etc.) when using the SOF dataset, given that some variables were collected at different visits (i.e. many years apart).
