# EEG Spectral Analysis

Sleep is a complex dynamic process often quantified through spectral analysis of the electroencephalogram (EEG). Quantitative EEG (qEEG) analysis has been shown to be associated with wake period length, brain state, memory consolidation, cognitive development and decline, and psychological states. NREM and REM are two distinct sleep states that progress from lighter to deeper sleep. NREM and REM states cycle throughout the night with the distribution of NREM/REM states changing across the night. Sleep complexity as well as the complexity of the association of sleep with psychological/behavioral states suggesting the need for methods such as spectral analysis for quantifying EEG dynamics. Spectral analysis of the EEG signal was proposed early in the study of EEG analysis and continues to be a commonly used approached to analyze EEG signals. Spectral analysis transforms the EEG times-series into a compact representation that is defined as a sum of sinusoidal signals with different frequencies. The current gold standard approach to applying spectral analysis to EEG studies involves manual identification and removal of EEG artifacts prior to performing spectral analysis. Commercial software tools for manually identifying artifacts and performing spectral analysis are commonly provided as part of an EEG data collection system or can be purchased as a standalone software product. Our estimates for performing spectral analysis with manual artifact detection by the gold standard approach range between 1 and 2 hours per lead in each study. Although commercial software tools provide a turnkey solution for analyzing small numbers of sleep studies, the cost of manual artifact detection can become prohibitive when epidemiological scale (thousands of studies) of spectral analysis is required. In order to the address the need for a computationally efficient spectral analysis program an analysis pipeline was developed that includes integrated artifact detection, provides a wide range of spectral parameters, and can automatically create spectral reports and figures. The objective of the spectral analysis project was to reduce the effort required to perform spectral analysis on scored PSG (polysomnogram) data by automating artifact detection, spectral analysis and results reporting with the final goal of allowing sleep researchers to efficiently analyze their own datasets. For this purpose SpectralTrainFig and BlockEdfSummarizeFig were developed at BWH and validated as part of a configurable, computationally efficient and open source artifact detection and spectral analysis pipeline.
