# Polysomnography introduction

Data collection for PSG was standardized by use of standardized collection and display montages. Each unit used for collection was certified before use to maximize signal quality integrity throughout the EDF conversion and import into Compumedics Profusion software used for scoring.

- [Montage and Sampling Rate Information](:pages_path:/montage-and-sampling-rate-information.md)

## Signal and annotation files

[Raw polysomnography data](:files_path:/polysomnography) are available for 453 subjects. Each recording has a signal file (.EDF) and two versions of the event scoring and epoch staging annotations (.XML).

1. **[EDF](:files_path:/polysomnography/edfs)** - Signal files in the [European Data Format](http://www.edfplus.info/) exported from Compumedics Profusion.
2. **[XML (Profusion)](:files_path:/polysomnography/annotations-events-profusion)** - Annotation files exported from Compumedics Profusion. ([Learn more...](https://github.com/nsrr/edf-editor-translator/wiki/Compumedics-Annotation-Format))
3. **[XML (NSRR)](:files_path:/polysomnography/annotations-events-nsrr)** - Annotation files processed in the [EDF Editor and Translator](https://www.sleepdata.org/community/tools/12) tool.

NSRR XML files can be overlaid onto EDF signal files using the [EDF Viewer tool](https://sleepdata.org/community/tools/nsrr-edf-viewer). For more information about the XML translation (mapping) process, review the files available on the [EDF Editor and Translator Releases page](https://github.com/nsrr/edf-editor-translator/releases).

## Known issues

- Raw data and annotations for eight subjects (508, 1050, 1681, 2461, 2729, 3698, 5332, 7411) are not available due to prior data loss.

## History / changelog
